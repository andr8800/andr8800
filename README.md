##Introduction

Signature Work Portfolio
Hello,
My name is Michael Andreucci and I am currently a senior studying computer science. This README.md is a brief overview of some of the work I have done throughout my college career . I hope that after going through my featured projects and through this README you will get a better understanding of who I am, my interest in various subjects, and my skills in coding. 

I have been doing various programming related projects since early highschool which sparked my interest in computer science and pushed towards studying it more in college. One of the first programming projects I remember doing was soldering a 12x12 cube of LED lights together and programming the LEDs to light up in various patterns using an Arduino. That was really the first big project I took on and I loved the challenge of it and trying to work through the problems I encountered both on the hardware portion over it as well as the coding part. I think if I had not done that project in Highschool then I likely would not have chosen to study computer science in college. After my initial interest in computer science was sparked by my highschool projects and courses, I continued to learn and advance my programming knowledge which I hope is evident in the featured projects I will be talking about below. 

In addition to some of my personal programming projects I have done as an individual, the computer science courses I took at University of St. Thomas really improved my programming capabilities both in a technical and creative way. 

##Personal Website

This project that I worked on was the first webpage I had ever made. It was part of a web development course I took in 2022 and was my introduction to working with CSS and HTML. At the time I had already done some programming with Javascript, so that was not completely new, but this project definitely helped me grow and was also fun to work on. 

The focus of the webpage is an introduction to who I am and some of the things that interest me besides computer science. I used the Foundation Framework as the start of my code and then used CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create my webpages. Some of the challenges I faced while working on this project was manipulating the images I include on the webpages to interact with the other page elements how I wanted them to. Additionally, having to account for whether the webpage was being accessed by A computer versus an phone or tablet also had to be taken into account. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/andr8800/andr8800.github.io).
