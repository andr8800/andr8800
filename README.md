## Introduction

Signature Work Portfolio
Hello,
My name is Michael Andreucci and I am currently a senior studying computer science. This README.md is a brief overview of some of the work I have done throughout my college career . I hope that after going through my featured projects and through this README you will get a better understanding of who I am, my interest in various subjects, and my skills in coding. 

I have been doing various programming related projects since early highschool which sparked my interest in computer science and pushed towards studying it more in college. One of the first programming projects I remember doing was soldering a 12x12 cube of LED lights together and programming the LEDs to light up in various patterns using an Arduino. That was really the first big project I took on and I loved the challenge of it and trying to work through the problems I encountered both on the hardware portion over it as well as the coding part. I think if I had not done that project in Highschool then I likely would not have chosen to study computer science in college. After my initial interest in computer science was sparked by my highschool projects and courses, I continued to learn and advance my programming knowledge which I hope is evident in the featured projects I will be talking about below. 

In addition to some of my personal programming projects I have done as an individual, the computer science courses I took at University of St. Thomas really improved my programming capabilities both in a technical and creative way. 

## Personal Website

This project that I worked on was the first webpage I had ever made. It was part of a web development course I took in 2022 and was my introduction to working with CSS and HTML. At the time I had already done some programming with Javascript, so that was not completely new, but this project definitely helped me grow and was also fun to work on. 

The focus of the webpage is an introduction to who I am and some of the things that interest me besides computer science. I used the Foundation Framework as the start of my code and then used CSS, HTML, and Javascript to create my webpages. Some of the challenges I faced while working on this project was manipulating the images I include on the webpages to interact with the other page elements how I wanted them to. Additionally, having to account for whether the webpage was being accessed by A computer versus an phone or tablet also had to be taken into account. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/andr8800/andr8800.github.io). 

## Maze

This project is the most recent one that I have worked on. It is a maze game that generates a random layout maze and then the goal is to move the cursor through the maze without hitting the border of the maze. The interesting part of this is that it uses face tracking from the handsfree.js and BRFv4.js libraries and displays a cursor on the screen based on where the user is looking. This project was extremely interesting and challenging to work on for many reasons. I initially started just playing around with face/eye tracking and stumbled across many different libraries and APIs for tracking. After trying many different ones and experimenting with what kind of things were possible, I ended up using handsfree and BRFv4 because of their compatibility as well as they were easier to work with relative to some of the other libraries I tried. 

Apart from just being an interesting and interactive game that uses face tracking, working on this project also highlighted some of the implications and potential benefits face/eye tracking could have from an accessibility and common good standpoint. By using tracking like this, people with various disabilities could use face tracking in order to control things on a computer or phone screen. Although my specific project has a smaller scope than providing more accessibility to those who need it, it definitely made me think about how expanding on my project could go a long way and the potential benefits of continuing to work with various face/body tracking programs to help those who need it. The project can be seen [here](https://github.com/andr8800/Maze).

## Dynamic Webserver

This was one of the first projects I worked on that involved displaying data on a web server. I worked on it with two other students in my web development course and the purpose of it was to retrieve data from an API and display it in different ways on a web server. 

Since it was my first time really doing something like this, we ran into a fair amount of issues involving retrieving the data and figuring out the best way to display it on the web server. Similar to my personal webpage, we used Foundation as the framework for the pages and then had various HTML template designs which we altered and added to show the data we wanted. My group and I decided we wanted to use flight data as our database of choice and our web server would retrieve data and display things like flight dates, locations, times, airlines and other information related to the specific flights.
