# CISC480
Signature Work Portfolio
Hello,
  My name is Michael Andreucci and I am currently a senior studying computer science. This README.md is a brief overview of some of the work I have done throughout my college career . I hope that after going through my featured projects and through this README you will get a better understanding of who I am, my interest in various subjects, and my skills in coding. 

  I have been doing various programming related projects since early highschool which sparked my interest in computer science and pushed towards studying it more in college. One of the first programming projects I remember doing was soldering a 12x12 cube of LED lights together and programming the LEDs to light up in various patterns using an Arduino. That was really the first big project I took on and I loved the challenge of it and trying to work through the problems I encountered both on the hardware portion over it as well as the coding part. I think if I had not done that project in Highschool then I likely would not have chosen to study computer science in college.
